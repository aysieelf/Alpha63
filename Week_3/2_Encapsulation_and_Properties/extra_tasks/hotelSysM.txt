release_room(room_number): Releases a booked room, logs the event.
list_rooms(): Prints details of all rooms.
list_available_rooms(): Prints details of available rooms.
get_event_log(): Returns the event log.
Test Script
Create a test script (main.py) to verify that your classes work correctly. Your test script should:

Create a Hotel instance with a name and capacity.
Create and add some Room instances to the hotel.
Test booking and releasing rooms.
Print the list of all rooms and available rooms before and after booking.
Print the event log to verify that events are being recorded correctly.
